NAME
    Module::Install::ReadmePodFromPod - A Module::Install extension to
    automatically convert POD to a README.pod

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL
      use Module::Install::ReadmePodFromPod;
      readme_pod_from 'lib/Some/Module.pm';

    A "README.pod" file will be generated from the POD of the indicated
    module file. If there is no file specified, try to use the file from
    'all_from', if there is one, otherwise die.

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::ReadmePodFromPod is a Module::Install extension that
    generates a "README.pod" file automatically from an indicated file
    containing POD, whenever the author runs "Makefile.PL".

    With github Since POD rendering support entered I want to place
    README.pod automatically.

    takes many test codes and documents from Module::Install::ReadmeFromPod.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "readme_pod_from"
        Does nothing on the user-side. On the author-side it will generate a
        "README.pod" file using perldoc from the POD in the file passed as a
        parameter.

          readme_pod_from 'lib/Some/Module.pm';

        If you don't specify a file, we look for the file specified in the
        'all_from' command (if one exists)

          all_from 'lib/Some/Module.pm';
          readme_pod_from; ## builds README.pod from Some::Module
